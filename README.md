# House Price Prediction

Creating a model that will allow the company to accurately predict the sale prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.


#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective

Hass consulting is looking to determine which factors affect the price of houses for sale. This will be used in coming up with a model that predicts the price of the houses when the various factors are fed into the model.

### Methods Used
* Data understanding to know the unique characteristics of the data set provided
* Data cleaning to remove null values and columns that are not required for the analysis
* Perform EDA
* Perform any necessary feature engineering 
* Check of multicollinearity
* Start building the model
* Cross-validate the model
* Compute RMSE
* Create residual plots for your models, and assess their heteroscedasticity 
* using Bartlettâ€™s test

## Project Description

Hass consulting is looking to determine which factors affect the price of houses for sale. This will be used in coming up with a model that predicts the price of the houses when the various factors are fed into the model.

## Getting Started

Creating a model that will allow the company to accurately predict the sale prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.

The following approaches will be used to find the best model for the prediction:

* Multiple Linear Regression
* Quantile Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso Regression
* Elastic Net Regression
